One of the most obvious functions of an operating system is to create shortcuts to pieces of software.
This takes the form of an icon that once clicked, sends you to predesignated software.
A copy of this link icon can be formed by right clicking the icon and selecting create shortcut.

Another function of an operating system is to store files in an orderly fashion.
It does this by creating folders that can have additional subfolders to store different types of information.
An example of this is a folder called week 5 having 2 folders called assignment 1 and assignment 2. 
Creating 2 assignment folders serves to lessen the confusion as to what work goes to which assignment.
Note(Try to label every file, if you don't things will be confusing because every file will be named the same thing).

The final function of an OS that I'm going to talk about is taking screenshots.
To take a screenshot with windows 10, hold down the window button + the printscreen button.
To snip a small part of the screen, hold down the windows button + shift + s.
From there you can click on the screen snip button and drag the box over where you want the screenshot to be taken.
